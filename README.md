# Block Journal 

This is a project meant to help with tracking activities over time in a fun, easily visible way. 
Each log represents some activity and has a corresponding colorful block added to your day. Over the course of your day
you can add as many activity block logs as you want, edit them, remove them, and bask in the colorful productivity

## To Get Started
1. Create an Activity/Habit - Enter basic information like name of activity
2. *New*: Add a detail to the activity/habit that you want to track each time you create a log for the activity
3. Tap the Activity that is created to log your first block!


### Context Menus Are Your Friend
If you feel like something is missing(... It probably is, but on the off-chance its not) try holding down UI elements for extra features. Quick and dirty way to get the functionality there until the UI is more fleshed out.

## Statistics
View your habits over time in the statistics view, filter through them and be flabberghasted at the life you've built through blocks. Watch your major statistics like "best streak", "most completions", "avgerage records per day" and more change dyanmically according to you filtered activities!

## Current Focus
Design a way to attach a value to your activity record - A rating for how well you slept, or how long you journaled, or how many reps of your physical therapy you did, or how much study time you had, or how long you read, or how long your walk was. In addition to number values, enable users to log notes - attach text values to activity record logs as well. Display these when viewing the details of the activity record.

By the end of this feature, users should be able to see details of their activity records. For activities with associated number values, it would be displayed as a chart demonstrating the change over time. For activities with textual details, like summary or description, there will be a separate list showing record details where they can read what has been written over time.
