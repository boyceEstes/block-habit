 * This is because there is some problem with deleting habit not cascading
 * and deleting the records properly... I think. The error that I have been getting
 * looks like this:

         init(initialValue) {
                     _$backingData.setValue(forKey: \.color, to: initialValue)

         }

     get {
                     _$observationRegistrar.access(self, keyPath: \.color)
HERE >>>                     return self.getValue(forKey: \.color)
         }

     set {
                     _$observationRegistrar.withMutation(of: self, keyPath: \.color) {
                             self.setValue(forKey: \.color, to: newValue)

 * I have tried making the Habit property optional, but that doesn't do aything.
 * I tried messing with the simulator's database, to delete a habit record without deleting
 * any of its records and it gives the same error as I'm seeing naturally happen on my
 * physical device... I can't figure out another way to reproduce it. It usually works
 * fine on the simulator.
 *
 * The repro steps in making this occur the first time:
 * 1. Delete some "Habit"
 * 2. Create some Habit Record.
 * ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ Crash
 * App will no longer open up because the records saved are in a bad spot.
 *
 * TLDR: This will be my solution which will manually delete the records first before deleting
 * a habit
